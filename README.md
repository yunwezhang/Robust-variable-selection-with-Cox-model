# Robust-variable-selection-with-Cox-model

This repository provides codes for comparing robust and non-robust variable selection methods with the Cox model for high-dim bioinformatic and biomedical data. We provide an easy-to-follow R file 'run_comparison.Rmd' to illustrate how users can easily use our function to compare these methods on a simulated dataset and a real dataset.   
We provide the dependent packages 'ncvreg2' as a .zip file and the source files: 'pawph.R', 'pawph_mcp.R' and 'pawph_scad.R'. 

This repository corresponds to our manuscript xxx. We also include all high-resolution figures under the 'Figure' folder. 

## install the "ncvreg2" package
```
install.packages('ncvreg2_3.13.0.tar.gz', repos=NULL, type='source')
```
